                    My name is David Chung and I am an aspiring web developer, interested in creating, updating, and maintaining websites. <br>
                    This includes ensuring that websites are adhering to accessibility standards and are user friendly <br>
                    and building websites independently from the bottom up, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
                    I received my Bachelor's in Psychology at University of California, Los Angeles, and my Master's in Applied Behavior Analysis from Sage Colleges. <br>
                    Previously, I worked with individuals with autism, ensuring that they were developing the skills that they needed to match their same-age peers. <br>
                    One such skill that was taught was communication skills, <br>
                    so that the individuals were able to communicate their wants and needs to those around them using methods such as <br>
                    pointing, verbally speaking, or using an Augmentative and Alternative communication device. <br>
                    Communication is a key skill in all professional careers and personal relationships.
